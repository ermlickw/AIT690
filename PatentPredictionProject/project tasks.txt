Milestones of project

1. data processing:
    (1) represent each document by a feature vector.
    (2) construct a network based on the cosine similarity between every two documents and use adjcant matrix to represent          this network.
    (3) what we want from this process is: feature vectors for each document and a adjacent matrix.

2. Document classification:
    (1) using DCNN model to do the semi-supervised learning 
    (2) test the document classification results

3. Baseline and gold-standard comparation experiment
    (1) using simple classifier, e.g. SVM or MLP as baseline results.
    (2) using a popular model (from existing lieratures) as gold standard.
